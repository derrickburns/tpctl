Each subdirectory in this directory represents a package that may be installed in a cluster.

Packages are independent of the destination cluster and of each other. This means there there should be
NO dependencies on the cluster in which the code is installed nor on other packages, unless the latter
are marked global in the `value.yaml` file.
